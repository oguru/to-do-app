# Todo List Creator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Description
A to do list creator tech test, utilising React, Redux and React Router.

### Test Specification

Please create a TODO List application, in React, which users can use to add, view and delete TODO items (called “TODOs”). Example TODOs in the list might be:

- Wash the car

- Mow the lawn

- Do the washing-up


When starting the application, the list should be empty. There should be a form for adding new TODOs, somewhere to view all TODOs, and a way to tick off (i.e. remove) TODOs.

This project is intended to be a way for you to demonstrate your coding abilities, and your ability to create user interfaces. The code and the UI do not need to be complicated, and this should take under 3 hours. If you can, please use TypeScript. Similarly, if you can, use Redux to store the TODOs.

If you want to, you can use Create React App to set up your application. For this project, we will be primarily looking at and discussing the React components that you create, rather than the configuration files (i.e. Webpack or similar).

## Future Considerations

If I work on this project in the future, possible improvements include:
- Draggable list items to enable re-ordering
- Icon selector when adding a new item which will display next to the to-do item
- Autocomplete feature for common items like “clean the house”
- Voice control to transcribe speech to text
- More comprehensive tests
- Ability to save to a database (and/or persist through browser storage)


## Setup
1 - Clone the repository.\
2 - Install dependencies with ```yarn install``` or ```npm install```.\
3 - Run ```yarn start``` or ```npm run start``` in the project directory from the command line .\
4 - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
5 - Run ```yarn test``` or ```npm run test``` to run tests.
